This directory should contain 3D models in GLTF format.

To use with the Explora animation, you'll need to add a file named "ico-more.glb" in this directory.
The 3D model should contain a "Voronoi_Fracture" object for the exploding effect to work properly.

If the model is not found, a placeholder cube will be displayed instead.
